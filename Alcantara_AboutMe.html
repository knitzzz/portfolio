                        <p id="indento">Hi! My name is Justin, and I am currently a sophomore in Dublin High School. As of now, I do not have any specific goals for a career, nor am I sure what field or job I want in the future, but I am leading towards a profession in computer science. Currently, I take interest in having a career in video game development; I am working towards this goal by taking computer classes in school (like Computer Science Engineering), and engaging in related hobbies, including digital drawing, creative writing, and playing competitive video games. I have always had an interest in both computers and creative activities, and game development incorporates the two in a fun way.</p><p id="indento">I am very positive, knowledgeable, and a natural leader. I take interest in a variety of subjects as mentioned earlier, and have gained experience and some skills from them. For example, I volunteered as a photographer for three consecutive years in my church's Vacation Bible School program, and have not only developed photography skills, but also had to organize group pictures, work with children, and collaborate with the couple other photographers. Most of my other few skills, such as in drawing and writing, were developed through hobbies.  I have a positive mindset and a good amount of experience, so I try my best to come up with the best solution in any given situation. I have also achieved Principal's Honor Roll every year since 6th grade, and I am currently volunteering in different service and leadership programs.</p><p id="indento">Although I am still deciding on what career to pursue, I work to set myself up to be successful in whatever I decide on. Thank you for reading, and feel free to explore the rest of my site!</p>
