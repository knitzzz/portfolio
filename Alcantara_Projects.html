                        <p>In this project for Computer Science Engineering, we were put into groups of two to create a game/program with App Inventor 2, based on a given template. My partner and I had to assign roles at the start of the project to get both the app and the design notebook finished by the deadline, which was in about three weeks. My job was to design the user interface, do the majority of the coding, and help design the gameplay. The most prominent lesson I learned from doing this project was the importance of having a plan, or at least working in the intended direction from the start. The lack of time-planning and prioritizing features left the final version more compromised than we wanted. Despite its flaws, my partner and I divided the work evenly and communicated often about changes and updates. We did run into multiple problems, usually dealing with the inconveniences of using App Inventor, but we were able to get the important gameplay features in, and ended up receiving an A on the project. The design notebook can be seen <a id="bluelink" href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/18z3JcOUA-hikslchGX22o1Di94OF4cAKD55ShZZijSU/edit?usp=sharing>here</a>.</p>
