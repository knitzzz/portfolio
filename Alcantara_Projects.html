                        <p>In this project for Computer Science Engineering, we were put into groups of two to create a game/program with App Inventor 2, based on a given template. My partner and I had to assign roles at the start of the project to get both the app and the design notebook finished by the deadline, which was in about three weeks. My job was to design the user interface, do the majority of the coding, and help design the gameplay. The most prominent lesson I learned from doing this project was the importance of having a plan, or at least working in the intended direction from the start. The lack of time-planning and prioritizing features left the final version more compromised than we wanted. Despite its flaws, my partner and I divided the work evenly and communicated often about changes and updates. We did run into multiple problems, usually dealing with the inconveniences of using App Inventor, but we were able to get the important gameplay features in, and ended up receiving an A on the project. The design notebook can be seen <a id="bluelink" href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/18z3JcOUA-hikslchGX22o1Di94OF4cAKD55ShZZijSU/edit?usp=sharing>here</a>.</p>

                        <p>In this project for Computer Science Engineering, we were put into groups of two to create a Python function that manipulates a folder of images to one of multiple given themes for fictitious clients. Our pair chose the "Product" client, which ordered us to create a function that can be placed on an image to promote their product. The client we came up with was a parodic toothpaste brand called "Colgato." We divided tasks between each other, and had about two and a half weeks to finish the project. I did most of the coding and troubleshooting, though got help documenting and developing our project from my partner. This project was a bit of a leap from the previous ones, as it was very open as to what our final product could be, since the guidelines were vague. With proper planning, however, my partner and I set our goals properly and got our project done by the deadline. All of the primary, and some of the secondary priorities were finished.
